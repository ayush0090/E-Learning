  <p class="Getting-started"> Hello and Welcome To Python Tutorials For Beginners , first let's try to install<span
      style="color:red;font-weight:bold"> Python's</span> latest version,let's head over to the <a
      href="http://python.org">Download</a> page of python.
    <img src="./../image/python_download1.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Download"><br>
    This is the Homepage of <a href="http://python.org">Python.org</a> After landing on this page you to click on
    downloads options, you will see something like this,

    Currently The Latest Version which is available for download is 3.9 on Windows, after this all you need to do is
    download the latest version for your OS, and install it, one important thing to do is
    to click on the Add Python to path as shown in the image below it is very Important step that will save you lots of

  <h2>Writing Hello World Program</h2>
  <p class="Getting-started">Good Going, Now that you have installed python we can proceed to the next step, let's write
    Hello World Program. For Python.
    first search for the <b>IDLE</b> by pressing windows key , and open it (this is for windows users). For other OS
    users you can use console and search for the <b>IDLE</b>.
    <br><img src="./../image/program1.png" class="img-fluid" alt="program1"><br>
    Now after opening it you should see something like this:
    <br><img src="./../image/program2.png" class="img-fluid" alt="program2"><br>
    Now click on the File Icon and select the <b>New File</b> option you will be getting a blank editor. Great!
    Now let's write our first program in Python. Before that few things to keep in mind are:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>In Python we don't use semicolons</li>
      <li>Here there's no concept of Curly Braces to show the end and start scope of any particular function</li>
      <li>Python Follows Identation Rules , thus you need to take care of Identation in Python</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    Alright!, that's enough for now let's make this interesting and write our program<br>
    <img src="./../image/program3.png" class="img-fluid" alt="helloworld">
    Save the above file and run it you should see Hello World as the output. Pretty simple right :P , Python is the language with which you will have lot's of fun and it's easy to learn and understand too. 
    Now let's try to understand our code , in the above example I have used <b>Print</b> function of python. Which Basically gives the output, the syntax is <b>print( *Whatever You Want to Print*)</b>
